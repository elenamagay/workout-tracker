## Description

This week my assignment was to create a workout tracker using Mongo database with Mongoose schema and Express. The front end code was already provided.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Installation

```
npm init -y
npm i express
npm i mongoose
npm i morgan
```
